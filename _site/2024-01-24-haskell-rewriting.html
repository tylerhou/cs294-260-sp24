    <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>Fundamentally, the GHC rewrite system in this paper makes a tradeoff between simplicity and functionality in
favor of practical implementation. Rewrite rules are written in Haskell itself as programmer-defined pragmas
and are constrained to mapping function applications to a presumably simpler RHS. However, there are few
guardrails on board; rules aren’t automatically checked for correctness, confluence, or termination by GHC.
How can this power be wielded safely?</p>

<p>The authors put forward this system mainly as a compiler extension intended for library authors rather than
general users. By design, rules are meant to be easily verified—possibly by feeding them into a theorem
prover. Moreover, compiler metadata can accompany library code and aid in downstream optimization
without the user ever explicitly managing it.</p>

<p>List fusion serves as a nice example with significant practical performance gains. The core idea with the
“short-cut deforestation approach” is to eliminate intermediate list materialization when we find pairs of
“consumer” and “producer” functions; <code class="highlighter-rouge">foldr</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">build</code>, respectively. <code class="highlighter-rouge">foldr</code>’s implementation is
straightforward; <code class="highlighter-rouge">build</code> seems a bit alien with some FP abstractions. Essentially, it abstracts the notion of
“cons” and “nil” list constructors such that “nil” is just a starting value and “cons” incorporates an element
into some amalgamation of elements. The rewrite rule transforms terms where <code class="highlighter-rouge">foldr</code> is applied to <code class="highlighter-rouge">build</code>:
we’re able to fold the values as we generate the list, skipping an intermediate allocation.</p>

<p>Here’s the hydrocarbon example annotated so you can see how pairs can be eliminated:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>foldr (length) -&gt; Int
  build (outer list comprehension) -&gt; [(i_1, j_1, k_1), (i_2, j_2, k_2)...]
    foldr (tuple consumer) -&gt; (i, j k)
      build (multiple list ranges) -&gt; [0...n]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Inlining complicates things: we have a phase ordering problem as <code class="highlighter-rouge">foldr</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">build</code> shouldn’t be inlined,
until their rule can’t be used anymore. We need a “rewrite strategy,” ideally where we start from the top of
the ADT hierarchy, rewrite all we can, inline and repeat at a lower level. Again, in the interest of simplicity,
this system has the programmer specify phases when inlining should happen with respect to the compiler.
However, this isn’t ideal as it requires knowledge of GHC’s phases. Additionally, isolated calls to functions
which use <code class="highlighter-rouge">foldr</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">build</code> are a performance drain as fusion isn’t possible. As a fail-safe for efficiency, a
“back-out” function definition and corresponding rewrite rule can be added to prevent this.</p>

<p>Moreover, sometimes we want transformations that end up substituting a redex into a lambda body in order
to trigger a <code class="highlighter-rouge">foldr</code>/<code class="highlighter-rouge">build</code> rewrite. GHC fights against this with conventional wisdom and prevents fusion,
so we need to identify “one-shot lambdas” where extraction would be useless as it’s only called once
anyway. Type-based analysis for this problem is worth looking into—although a simple hardcoded solution
for <code class="highlighter-rouge">build</code> works here. Sharing computation in general can prevent fusion in other contexts; one potential
approach is to use a “virtual data type” which the compiler can inline without worrying about sharing. This
section is left open in the paper.</p>

<p>Having established how programmers can write rules, the paper discusses a few ways in which the compiler
can dynamically generate them by performing a local transformation and generating + applying a
corresponding rule. This is particularly useful for specializing functions or cases that are often used, like type-
specification and boxing/unboxing literals. Usage-based specialization is an interesting area to explore
further, as this system provides a clean mechanism to incorporate this information as extra arguments which
can be rule-matched.</p>

<p>The paper concludes with a more involved application in the context of CSPs and outlines the benefits of an
explicit tree-based approach in Haskell with optimizations courtesy of this system. The approach is very
analogous to the earlier list fusion example, only applied to rose tree fusion. Although there is still a slight
performance gap between this and imperative approaches, the extensibility and ease-of-use is a massive
advantage; only 2 components need to be modified: the labeler and pruner, which check and remove nodes
to maintain consistency.</p>

<p>However, the same sorts of issues pop up here. Notably, now inlining list functions should happen after tree
functions (which can be enforced through phase ordering on module dependencies). Additionally, a key
practical note is the need for programmer feedback when there are failures; currently, it’s not always clear
whether these indicate a legitimate no-fusion situation or simply programmer error.</p>
